## Installation

To set up Koi on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/koi-bot.git
   cd koi-bot
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have [Python 3.11.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/) installed. I say this as this is the version I used to run the bot. 
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your environment variables**:
   The bot token should be placed in a file at the root of the repository named `token.txt`
   Your api information for Retroachievements API should go in a file called `api_info.txt`

6. **Start the bot**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
